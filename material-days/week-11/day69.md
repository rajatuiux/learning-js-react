  * Components & Props
  * State & Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)
  * Event handling & forms
  * Conditional rendering & lists
  * Routing with React Router
  * Data fetching & API integration
  * Developer tools & debugging
  * Styling with CSS and CSS Modules
  * Creating reusable components
  * Building simple projects (To-Do List & Weather App)

### 2. Preparing for Deployment

* Before deploying, ensure your app works well locally.
* Test on different browsers and devices if possible.
* Optimize performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

---

### 3. Deployment Options

* **Vercel** and **Netlify** are popular platforms to deploy React apps for free.
* **GitHub Pages** can also host React apps for free.

---

### 4. Deploying with Vercel (Basic Steps)

1. Create an account on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
2. Connect your GitHub repository containing your React app.
3. Vercel automatically detects React and builds your app.
4. Your app will be live on a generated URL.
5. Every push to GitHub triggers an automatic redeploy.

---

### 5. Deploying with Netlify (Basic Steps)

1. Create an account on [netlify.com](https://netlify.com).
2. Connect your GitHub repo or drag and drop your build folder.
3. Netlify builds and deploys your app automatically.
4. You get a live URL with custom domain options.

---

### 6. Building React App for Production

* Run:

```bash
npm run build
```

* Creates a `build/` folder with optimized files.
* This folder is what you deploy.
